**You need a Module called node-fetch to run this function
You can download by writing `npm install node-fetch` in your current working/main directory**

`const grim = require('./grimauth')`
You can access [grimauth.js](./grimauth.js) File like this

Now with `grim` variable you can access `grimauth()`

**there is a parameter in grimauth i.e., Auth Key. So, Pass your Auth Key in `grimauth(<key>)` and get the status in return. Below Check Status value on how to handle those**

**Note - `grimauth()` is a callback function
If you want to know how to use callback function you can check in [index.js](./index.js) on how to use `grimauth()` function**
